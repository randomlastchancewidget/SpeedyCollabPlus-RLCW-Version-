# SpeedyCollab Plus - One of the best and fastest macros!

SpeedyCollab Plus is a video editing tool by Blue Mars and Salad.

This is still a work in progress so it may be buggy! It also creates a bunch of temp files in a /tmp folder that you will need to delete when you're done. If you try to run too many iterations it may take a long time.

## The wiki
Go to the [original version](https://github.com/saladhub/SpeedyCollabPlus).
## Installation

Get a version of the program [here](https://github.com/saladhub/SpeedyCollabPlus/releases)!

Extract the ZIP you downloaded and head to SpeedyCollabPlus-main.

### 4. Install Dependencies

Install the required dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all the necessary libraries such as tkinter, Pillow, pyaudio, and more.


#### Troubleshooting

Make sure you have python in your PATH.

Or you can use pip like this!

```bash
py -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If that doesnt work then just reinstall Python and check the "Add to PATH" option.

### 5. Run the Application

Now that the dependencies are installed, you can run the application by executing the following command:

```bash
python -m app.main
```

This will launch the UI where you can select a video file, input the number of iterations, and specify an output file name. The app will then start processing the video.

### Work in Progress

This is still a WIP! Will try to implement features from newer versions (if they ever release)
